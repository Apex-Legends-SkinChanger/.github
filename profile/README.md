## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: Will others see my custom skins?**
No — visuals are local only and affect what *you* see. Online visibility remains unchanged.

**Q2: Can I use custom textures?**
Yes! You can import your own `.png` or `.dds` files for weapons and legends.

**Q3: Does it work with new updates?**
The SkinChanger auto-updates offsets via cloud sync whenever Apex Legends patches.

**Q4: Are heirlooms permanent?**
They’re visual-only. You can toggle them off anytime without risk or save multiple heirloom profiles.

**Q5: Is this safe to use on my main account?**
It does not interact with gameplay or servers, so it’s as safe as cosmetic mods can be — but always back up your config files.

## 🧩 Advanced Tips
